## üß© Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

* **WebDriver not found**:
  Ensure `chromedriver` or `geckodriver` is installed and correctly added to your system's `PATH`.

* **Blank data page**:
  Make sure scraping has completed and `scraped_ads.csv` exists with data.

* **Scraping too slow**:
  Headless browsers introduce delays to avoid bans. You can reduce delays in the code cautiously.
